## Current State

| Component | Status | Version/Notes |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **Spec** | Active | 2.0.0-alpha.4 (3 constructs merged) |
| **Target** | X.com PWA | Feed + Compose + Notifications |
| **Compiler (Vue)** | Not started | COMPILER/vue/ |
| **Compiler (React)** | Not started | COMPILER/react/ |
| **Build Attempts** | 0 | BUILDS/x-pwa/ |

## Battle Learnings Summary

Six battles completed across two rounds. Key findings:

### Coverage by App Type
| App | Type | Coverage | Key Insight |
|-----|------|----------|-------------|
| Cowch | Vanilla JS web | ~80% | Gestures, animations need work |
| Alexander | Vue + Supabase | ~65-70% | Reactive state, external integrations |
| Popty | Vue + Vite | ~55% | Domain vocabulary, pipelines, WebSocket |
| Zenjin Maths | Vue + Supabase | ~72% | State machines, navigation guards |
| Signal iOS | Native Swift | ~25-35% | **Mobile is out of scope for now** |
| X.com PWA | Unknown (observation) | ~45-55% | Real-time, infinite scroll, optimistic UI |

### Decision: Web-First
Signal battle confirmed native mobile requires fundamentally different constructs. APML v2.0 will focus on **web platforms** (PWA, SPA) which can then target mobile via PWA.

## Active Gaps (Priority Order)

These gaps appeared in 3+ battles and block the X.com PWA build:

| # | Gap | Battles | Status | Proposal Location |
|---|-----|---------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Real-time/WebSocket** | Popty, Signal, X.com, Zenjin | 🟢 Merged | v2.0.0-alpha.3 |
| 2 | **State machines** | Alexander, Zenjin, Cowch, X.com | 🔴 Open | LEARNINGS/gap-registry.md |
| 3 | **Optimistic UI** | Cowch, Alexander, X.com | 🟢 Merged | v2.0.0-alpha.2 |
| 4 | **Computed/reactive values** | All 6 battles | 🟢 Merged | v2.0.0-alpha.4 |
| 5 | **Infinite scroll/virtualization** | X.com | 🔴 Open | LEARNINGS/gap-registry.md |
| 6 | **External integrations** | Alexander, Zenjin, Popty, X.com | 🔴 Open | LEARNINGS/gap-registry.md |
| 7 | **Navigation guards** | Popty, Zenjin | 🔴 Open | LEARNINGS/gap-registry.md |
| 8 | **Gestures** | Cowch, X.com | 🟡 Lower priority | LEARNINGS/gap-registry.md |

## Next Actions

### Immediate (for next agent)
1. Consolidate all gap proposals from battle reports into `LEARNINGS/gap-registry.md`
2. Draft syntax proposals for top 5 gaps
3. Update `APML-V2-SPEC.md` with new constructs

### After Spec Update
4. Create basic Vue compiler scaffold in `COMPILER/vue/`
5. Attempt first X.com PWA build (just the feed view)
6. Document what works/fails in `BUILDS/x-pwa/build-log.md`

---

## Victory Condition

An agent can:
1. Read the APML spec for X.com PWA
2. Run the compiler
3. Get a working web app that matches X.com's core functionality:
   - [ ] Infinite scrolling feed
   - [ ] Post composition
   - [ ] Like/repost/bookmark (with optimistic UI)
   - [ ] Real-time notifications
   - [ ] Pull-to-refresh

## Agent Instructions

If you are an agent picking up this work:

1. **Read this file first** - understand current state
2. **Check "Next Actions"** - pick the next uncompleted task
3. **Do the work** - update relevant files
4. **Update CONTEXT.md** - change "Last Updated", add notes to relevant sections
5. **Commit with clear message** - `[SWARM] <what you did>`

Keep the loop going. Every agent makes progress. No work is lost.
